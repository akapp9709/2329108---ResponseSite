      The readings for this week focused onhow play is entanglkewd with everyday
      life and how play makes the daily monotony of life more bearable and thus
      more livable.
      <br />
      To define play outside of games and the conventiuonal idea of play is
      proven to be a difficult task even for scholars more experience and well
      versed than I, however my simplest definition would be to say that play is
      the small, nonintegral action that we do to accomodate our boring or
      tedious tasks. Play is the backbone of enjoyment and the brain of
      bearability, as life is often overrrun with tedious tasks and little
      motivationor attentions span to finally get to them.

      Being stuck in traffic is hated by most people, special individuals enjoy
      bing in heavy traffic. Personally, heavy traffic isn't so bad, I don't
      have to be productive, I have an excuse as to why I am not where I need to
      be, and finally I can distract myself with music in the safe space that is
      my cars interior.

      In Miguel Sicart wrote in <i>Play Matters</i> that "To Play is to be in
      the world", meaning that play is everywhere - you may feel it in the
      water, feel it in the earth, and possibly even feel it in the air - and in
      everything you do. To be able to platy with something or while performing
      an action shows that you have an understanding of how that thing functions
      or the absolutely integral parts of a task, the understanding shopws
      because you knwop where the wiggle room is - seasoned ballroom dancers
      often switch up and add motions to the dance but are still able to keep
      the same step and speed, and heavy machinary operators are often seen
      messing around with their machines because they simply know the strength
      and capabilities of their equipment. <br />
      An interesting quote is "we are the fools looking at the finger when
      somebody points at the moon". I interpret this to mean that games are
      teaching us how to play in real life, and are serving to show the
      possibilities of creativity, ideas, and art. <br />
      Games teach us so much in terms of history, ideas, and enjoyment, by
      playing a game you could learn what you enjoy, how you think, and evenwaht
      might emotionally effect you - seeing a character finally reach a goal
      after an entire franchise might makew you inexplicably happy, but it is an
      experience that you coulds learn from. <br />
      A games setting can teach you about it history,even if the story told is
      not a true story such as <i>Ghost of Tsushima</i>, where instead it
      teahces the history of culture through the story and how themes were
      treated by those people, such as honor, respect and sacrifice. <br />
      if games are meant to be teaching us something, then there is a question
      of what mainstream games are teaching. Even if people such as Sicart
      believe "Games don't matter",games are still forming part of the everyday
      for a decent portion of people, and being a large part of their
      experiences, they will form a portion of their learned abilities and
      attitudes. <br />
      Sicart says that "Play can be dangerous", as an addictive habit for some
      it can be destructive to ones health, similar to less subtle addictions.
      Play is also dangerous in that it presents a challenge, a challenge to
      continue playing, a challenge even to stop playing, or to platy nciely
      with others. These are all challenges because of the fragile framework on
      which play is often created, when there are more partakersinvolved, play
      becomes abalance between enjoyment and the other participants egos.
      Everyone involved in the play must subscibe too the idea being played
      with, else the framework topples, and the danger of play is made apparent.
      <br />
      As individuals subscribe to the play at hand, an environemtn begins to
      take shape around them, this is referred to as the "Magic Circle", this
      environment acts similar to the boundaries of a sports pitch, whereby, the
      rules of the Circle are superimposed over the rules of the outside. Within
      the Circle, there are new definitions, laws, and abilities available to
      the participants, and participanmts are challkenged further to push the
      boundaries of the real world and the inside of the Circle simultaneously.

      Eberle goes to name the six elements of play: anticipation, surprise,
      pleasure, understanding, strength, and poise, in
      <i>The Elements of Play</i>. Eberle agrees with Sicart that play is
      difficult to formally define, however he believs he can name the
      components of which play is built and experienced. <br />
      Anticipation occurs when the individual tries to predict what will occur.
      Anticipation si the tension before the fact where questioins are being
      raised and waiting toi be answered. These feeling are best known in games
      with bosses as the player approaches the boss room, but is also seen in
      the build up to a date or an event. It is the foresight and
      unpredictability acting against one another to build tension and stoke
      nerves. Anticipation is the preparation for play. <br />
      Surprise is the "reward" received from anticipation. As strange as that
      sounds - one does not simply anticipate a surprise - surprise is simply
      what comes after anticipation, it is the break the player receives as a
      result. Once morte its noit only in games, nor is it always positive -
      such as planning not to drive at peak time but traffic still occurs when
      you leave, and so consequence may be a better word than "reward". <br />
      Pleasure is the true reward. It is the sensation one gets when completing
      an objective or achieving some kind of success. Pleasure acts as the
      incentive to continue playing, compared to the other elements of play,
      pleasure is the most constant when play is conducted correctly as it is
      the driving force behind the act. <br />
      Understanding is the culmination of experience. It stems from empathy and
      knowledge, and both grow equally as we engage in play and learn about
      others that play and ourselves. As the understanding of play deepens, the
      complexity of play can grow naturally and so flows into strength. <br />
      Strength is the fortitude of both mind and body through play. Strength
      refers to ones abilities to overcome challenges, and speaks to those feats
      and the skills required to overcome them. <br />
      Poise is the final element of play, it represents a collective from all
      the individual's elements to form the individuals ability to play. This is
      often refered to as flow, it is when all seems to run on autopilot but the
      tasks and work seem to get done by themselves. <br />

      In conclusion, Sicart and Eberle both struggled to pin down an exact
      definition of play, but both in some way have determined thatb play is a
      fluid state that a person can simply enter when they need or when they
      want. <br />
      The need for play is massive given the daily stresses that most people are
      subjected to from work, home life or personal issues that need some care,
      and Play helps to keep things light and manageable for a short, but
      enjoyable time. <br />
      As a result of what has been discussed in this response, youare now able
      to purchase passive upgrades in the main clicker game. Thge intent is that
      clicking the button over and over becomes tedious and the passive upgrades
      will make it so you dont have to click as much.
