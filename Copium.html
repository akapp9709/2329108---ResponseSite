    <header>Coping with Stress Thgrough Play</header>
    <section>
      Stress unfortunately is a part of life, as a result, people have learnt to
      curtail its effects or simply how to reduce it in magnetude. Most achieve
      this through play or by "lightening the mood". These habits and play
      styles form a person's coping mechanisms and these include safe things
      such as playing a game - games in the mind and physical games - and
      fidgeting, and less safe mechanisms such as shutting down and self
      isolating. <br />
      <i>The Playful Advantage: How Playfulness Enhances Coping with Stress</i>
      by Cale D. Magnuson and Lynn A. Barnett is a study on how peoples' levels
      of play affect the amount of perceived stress that individual believes
      they experience in daily life. The study used university students as
      candidates and found that lower levels of stress were perceived by
      individuals with higher degrees of playfulness. The authors believe that
      this may be due to how these students framed their environment to more
      amusing or entertaining to them and as a result experienced less stress,
      however they alson state that this relationship is ambiguous at the best
      of times since both how stress affects the body and what the true meaning
      of play is are still mostly unanswered. <br />

      To start, I will be using my definition of Play that I discussed in a
      previous response. <br />
      That definition is that play is a break from tedium by performing actions
      over and above the task at hand to make the load feel less taxing and to
      make the tasks or general life more managable and enjoyable. Playing while
      performing a specific action shows an understanding of that task since you
      are becoming more confident with the task and thus know what is absolutely
      integral to the task - people that find maths fun are either doing it very
      wrong, or have a very good understanding of the work. <br />
      Stress is the antithesis of play. Stress is the building levels of anxiety
      or figurative weight that an individual experiences on the daily.This
      weight can be deadlines, feelings of unease, or the idea of being
      overwhelmed. <br />

      Using these definitions, it can be quite easy to see how these two things,
      Play and Stress are two sides of the same coin: stress is acting against
      pleasure, while play is enhancing it. Perhaps a coin is the wrong analogy
      then. Lets look at the two as more of a see-saw or a balance scale to
      treat it more elegantly. Stress is the object that is being bought from
      the individual, and play is the amount of currency required to bring the
      scales back to equilibrium or even to tip it back to lie completely on the
      side of play. <br />
      Looking at the relationship between play and stress as a transaction may
      simplify the entire enigma to a point. However, the transaction is
      different for everyone depending on how much their play is worth or how
      much stress they are present with. The analogy also brings an idea of
      balance with oneself and the activities they do - that work-life balance
      that most people in the workforce strive to achieve. <br />
      Self balance is at the core of most self-help programmes where people are
      pushed to experience, and improve on an array of skills in art, self-care,
      and even in more soft-skills such as meditation and awareness. However,
      none of these are directly related to play at first glance, but as
      discussed in <i>The Elements of Play</i> by Eberle, play is an opening to
      understanding, and thus learning. <br />
      One good thing that play is as ambiguous to define as it is, is that it is
      everywhere, and since anything can be made playful to some extent, the
      opportunity to play and potentially lessen that stress is always
      available. Having the chance to play at all times can help the individual
      keep balance in the face of stress as there is essentially abundant
      currency with which to make the transaction and keep the scales level.
      <br />
      However, most people experience stress differently and as shown in the
      study conducted in <i>The Playful Advantage</i>, people also exhibit
      different levels of playfulness. <br />
      The reading describes playful people as spontaneousm, energetic
      individuals with a tendency to make light of most situations. If we were
      to view individuals on a spectrum of playfulness where they receive a
      rating of 1 to 100 as a representation of how likely an individual is to
      be playful in any given situation, then it would appear given the
      previously discussed relationship can appear very linear - the more
      playful an individual is at all times, the less stress they belive they
      are under. <br />
      However, there are people such as myself that operate on more rotational
      play times. It is difficult to make a stressful situation more playful and
      such play is more of a reward for persevering through the situation than
      an active ability to lessen the levels of stress in the moment. Does this
      mean that these individuals are not playful? <br />
    </section>
    <section>
      I belive that just as stress is exhibited differently from person to
      person, play manifests itself differently based on the individual's skill
      set, upbringing, and general passtimes. Being such, defining the
      relationship between stress perception and playfulness becomes like curing
      cancer (in theory alone) in that symptoms, causes and make up are all
      different from person to person and even from situation to situation.
      <br />
      As such, the study's results point to more playful individuals not being
      under less stress, but rather being more comfortable in their ability to
      overcome the stress, as such stress and play in this context reinforce
      Eberle elements of play including understanding as the moew playful the
      individual, the more competent they feel. <br />
      This could even be related back to the games that people play, Souls-like
      games are infamously difficult, but people that have spent time
      understanding and playing them intrinsicly begin to internalize the
      playstyles and methods that make the game easier, and as such they find it
      more fun and bosses become less frustrating.

    <section>
      To internalize this idea of playing more leading to less stressful
      situations, a challenge will begin in the main clicker game, where yoiu
      need to pay off a bounty with a time limit. The idea is very simplified,
      but if you have played a decent amount of ther game, there should be very
      little consequence, however if very little has been done in the clicker
      game, the chances of failing and resetting the game entirely are increased
      to induce some levcel of stress.
