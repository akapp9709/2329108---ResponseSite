      Games are a uniquepiece of media due to them being interactive and giving
      their users agency over how to interact with it, and thus provides a
      generative experience for every player. <br />
      The question now stands if there is a correct way to play a game. Some
      games do not afford the player enough freedom to play incorrectly and
      still progress through the game's path but most games do afford these
      opportunities, to present extra challenge, make the game more ridiculous,
      or to allow the player to experiment. <br />
      For some games, it is even recommended to use thrid-party applications to
      help with certain aspects of the game, and does that make players that use
      these applications cheats, or are they playing the game wrong? <br />

      <i>The right way to play a game</i> by Thi Nguyen attempts to answer this
      question by discussing the use of mods as a tool for organisationor as an
      improvement to the quality of life within the game. The game in question
      is <i>World of Warcraft</i> and the use of UI mods that convey raid
      information to the entire raid group without the need for a dedicated
      messenger to keep track of the raid mechanics and events. <br />
      That is by no means cheating, players still need to communicate with one
      another about what to do at a given point, but all players on the team are
      now able to know what is happening in the raidwithout the need to lose a
      player to information brokering, thus helping the entire team but not
      trivializing the encounter. <br />
      As I haven't played World of Warcraft, I can only speak to Destiny 2 and
      the use of Destiny Item Manager to avoid the constant travelling needed to
      access the player vault to retrieve exotic gear or different weapons as
      well as a very useful farming mode that keeps the players inventory from
      being completely full, and sending gear to the postmaster and potentially
      losing that gear. <br />
      Using DIM alongside Destiny is a means of saving time and very little
      else, there is very little advantage to using it besides saving the trip
      to a vault kiosk or a trip to clear the postmaster every now and then,
      however, it does allow players to more easily clear dungeons and raids
      without leaving the activity and thus making it easier to get the
      achievements attached to them. However, these activites are already fairly
      difficult and players need to be quite seasoned in the game to take part
      and clear these activities, especially since the dungeonms needed to be
      completed solo and on each subclass. As such most players will avoid
      getting these achievements anyway, and so it only counts as cheating in
      specific cases and even then it provides no buffs or advantages while in
      the activity itself. <br />
      And so, improving the quality of life within a game does not make it so
      the player is playing incorrectly. However, some games come with full
      support of modding from bothn professional certified creators and solo
      creative individuals. Skyrim is one such game and it rides the line of
      being played correctly very well. Most mods that are made for skyrim are
      shader and graphics packs used to keep the game competitive withthe
      progressing visuals present in the games of today. <br />
      But some mods include an armory of sorts that can be accessed from the
      start of the game and ruins Skyrim's already shakey progression system by
      given players access to the strongest weapons in the game from the very
      start. However, one can argue that the freedom of Skyrims ability to be
      modded makes this to be players using the opportunity to the fullest and
      are thus playing it completely correctly. <br />

      The issue with defining the correct way to play a game is that once the
      game has left the studio and has been published, it is left entirely to
      the players to decide what the correct way to play is and the developers
      cannot say exactly how to play the game or try to curve the player's
      towards their preferred style <br />
      Take Minecraft for example. With every update to the game a new manual is
      released or updated to match the current state of the game, but none of
      them include how to make a mob farm for xp, that breeding villagers in a
      box is the best way to get the desired merchants, or that you can make an
      entire computer inside the game using Redstone. <br />
      Players have taken everything Minecraft has to offer and found a way
      around most of its core aspects, however, once again, if it is in the
      game, it must be intentional and thus cannot be really correct or
      incorrect in terms of how to play minecraft.

      Modding and freedom are not the same thing. Freedom in games is the
      designed outcomes and inclusions in the game - everything the player can
      do off the shelf. The freedom from mods usually extends the boundaries set
      by the developers and thus operate outside of the design of the game.
      <br />
      If we follow Nguyen's examples of licking canvases and swatting flies with
      a book, this is still the correct way to engage with the game by playing
      it and mods are simply players adding what they thought was missing to the
      game to keep it interesting and alive, and are thus playing the game
      correctly even while outside the designed scope of the game. <br />
      It can then be concluded that a game is being engaged correctly if the
      player is enagging with the game as a game even if they are not staying
      within the scope of the game published by the developers. <br />

      To give an attempt at the idea of player freedom, I will relate to the
      clicker game attached to these responses. There is a clear choice in how
      to play the game - to play very actively and focus on click upgrades
      because it is has the most potential, or to upgrade and focus on passive
      generation. Both ways to play are correct because they exist withion the
      game's structure and they both lead to the goal of generating more
      currency to use in the game. <br />
      However, if you were to approach the game as a roguelike or anything other
      than a casual clicker game would be to approach it incorrectly.
